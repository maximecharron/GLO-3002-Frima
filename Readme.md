# GLO-3002
Frima Project

<img src="https://travis-ci.com/maximecharron/GLO-3002-Frima.svg?token=sMqpFU1Ht4p25BHaUUto&branch=master">

The Frima project is composed of 4 components:
    - GameServer
    - CmsServer
    - CMS
    - Client

Please refer to the readmes for details on each of them. Each component is hosted on heroku. We are using Travis CI for continuous integration and continuous delivery. 

Please note that the project cannot be all runned locally. You can run each component separately but cannot run all the components locally to emulate the game. 

If you are installing on a cluster of servers, we recommend you use forever.js to keep the process active. 

If you are experiencing difficulties, please file an issue on Github or contact the project owners.
